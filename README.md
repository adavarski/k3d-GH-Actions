### GitHub Actions k8s demo: k3d & helm playground

This is a demo of how K3d can be used as part of a GitHub Actions Workflow for testing Helm charts.

K8s is Kubernetes. K3s is a lightweight K8s distribution. K3d is a wrapper to run K3s in Docker. K3d/K3s are especially good for development and CI purposes, as it takes only 20-30 seconds of time till the cluster is ready (for comparison, Kind/Minikube takes more time till ready)
